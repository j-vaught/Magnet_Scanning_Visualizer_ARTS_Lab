## Magnet Scanning Visualizer - ARTS Lab

Welcome to the Magnet Scanning Visualizer repository, developed by the Advanced Real Time Systems Laboratory (ARTS-Lab). This repository houses a powerful tool designed specifically for visualizing magnet data.

In the context of a sensor project, we conducted scans of a plane positioned above a magnet, capturing valuable magnetic field information. Leveraging the capabilities of this tool, we have meticulously processed and analyzed the collected data, resulting in a comprehensive and insightful representation of the magnetic field as a 3D plane.

To provide you with a visual glimpse into our findings, we have plotted the results in the form of an immersive and visually appealing image. By clicking the link below, you will be able to access this fascinating visualization:
